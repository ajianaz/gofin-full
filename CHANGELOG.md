# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **JWT token version/invalidation mechanism (C6)** — `token_version` column on users table tracks token invalidation; JWT access and refresh tokens include `token_version` claim; `AuthMiddleware` compares claim version against DB and rejects mismatched tokens (401 "Token has been invalidated"); `IncrementTokenVersion` repository method for callers to invalidate all tokens for a user (called on logout, password change, group membership removal)
- **Database migration** — `000012_token_version.up.sql` adds `token_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to users table
- **Change password endpoint** — `POST /users/me/password` validates current password, hashes new password (min 8 chars), and invalidates all existing JWT tokens via `IncrementTokenVersion`
- **Piggy bank alias routes** — `/wallets/:wallet_id/piggy_banks/:id/add` and `/remove` as aliases for `/add-money` and `/remove-money` for frontend compatibility
- **Database migration** — `000013_notes_locations_ownership.up.sql` adds `user_id` and `user_group_id` columns to notes and locations tables for ownership tracking

### Fixed
- **Withdrawal balance check (H8)** — `CreateTransaction` now verifies source wallet has sufficient `virtual_balance` before processing withdrawal; returns error with current and required amounts
- **Split transaction balance check** — `CreateSplitTransaction` aggregates debits per source wallet and validates each has sufficient balance before processing
- **Piggy bank withdraw balance check (H9)** — `RemoveMoney` now verifies piggy bank has sufficient current amount (from events) before allowing withdrawal
- **Piggy bank add wallet balance check (H9b)** — `AddMoney` now verifies source wallet has sufficient `virtual_balance` before moving money to piggy bank
- **Transaction split URL mismatch** — frontend `transactionService.split()` now sends correct payload (`type`, `date`, `journals`) to `POST /transactions/split` matching the backend API

### Fixed
- **Group update restricted to owner role (C1)** — `PUT /groups/:id` now requires `RoleOwner` RBAC middleware, matching the delete route
- **Wallet member Index group verification (C3)** — `GET /wallets/:wallet_id/members` now verifies the requesting user has a role on the wallet via `GetWalletRole`, returns 403 if unauthorized
- **Attachment Show/Delete user ownership (C4+H1)** — `Show` and `Delete` attachment handlers now verify the attachment belongs to the requesting user via `UserID` comparison, preventing cross-user access
- **DB transactions for money operations (C5)** — `CreateTransaction`, `CreateSplitTransaction`, and `DeleteTransaction` now wrap all multi-step operations (create group, journal, transactions, balance updates) in a single database transaction, preventing inconsistent state on partial failure
- **Webhook URL validation (H3)** — webhook create/update now validates URLs: blocks internal IPs (loopback, private ranges, cloud metadata endpoints), requires http/https scheme
- **JWT secret startup validation (H4)** — `config.Load()` rejects default JWT secret and secrets under 32 characters in production; development/testing/local environments are exempted
- **Rate limiter fail-secure on Redis failure (H5)** — when Redis is unavailable, the rate limiter now falls back to an in-memory sliding window limiter instead of allowing all requests through
- **Account lockout after failed logins (H6)** — after 5 consecutive failed login attempts, the account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes with a clear error message; counter resets on successful login; uses Redis INCR with TTL

### Fixed (Security Audit)

#### Critical
- **Notes group/user ownership scoping (C1)** — notes handler and repository now require user authentication, pass `user_id` and `group_id` on create, and verify ownership before update/delete
- **Locations group/user ownership scoping (C2)** — locations handler and repository now require user authentication, pass `user_id` and `group_id` on create, and verify ownership before delete
- **Configurations endpoint privilege escalation (C3)** — `POST /configurations` changed from `RoleOwner` to `AdminMiddleware()` to prevent non-admin users from setting system configurations
- **Attachments index group isolation (C4)** — attachment list now filters by `user_id`, preventing cross-user attachment visibility

#### High
- **Webhook messages IDOR (H1)** — `GET /webhooks/:id/messages` now verifies the webhook belongs to the requesting user's active group before returning messages
- **Audit logs using actual groupID (H3)** — audit log handler now passes the real `groupID` instead of hardcoded `0`
- **JWT invalidation on member removal (H4)** — removing a wallet member or deleting a group now calls `IncrementTokenVersion` to invalidate affected users' JWT tokens immediately
- **SSRF DNS rebinding prevention (H5)** — webhook URL validation now resolves DNS at validation time (not just string matching), preventing attackers from using DNS rebinding to reach internal services
- **Piggy bank TOCTOU race condition (H6)** — `AddMoney` now uses a DB transaction with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locking to prevent concurrent balance modifications
- **Request size limit middleware (H8)** — fixed the no-op `RequestSizeLimit` middleware to actually check `Content-Length` header and return 413; wired it into the router with `MaxRequestBodyBytes` config

#### Medium
- **CSV injection sanitization (M2)** — `sanitizeCSV` now trims whitespace before checking for formula prefixes, catching `\r\n=cmd` patterns
- **JWT secret validation in all environments (M3)** — removed the dev/local/testing bypass; JWT secret length and default value are always validated
- **In-memory rate limiter memory leak (M4)** — added periodic eviction (every 5 minutes) to remove stale rate limit entries, preventing unbounded memory growth
- **Export service token handling (M5)** — export service now uses consistent token retrieval pattern matching the central API client
- **IPv6 SSRF bypass (M6)** — webhook URL validation now explicitly checks IPv6 private ranges (`::1/128`, `fe80::/10`, `fc00::/7`)
- **CSV injection prevention (M3)** — user-controlled fields in CSV export (description, category, wallet names, notes, tags) are prefixed with a single quote when they start with formula characters (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, carriage return)
- **Exchange rate delete group filter (L3)** — `DELETE /exchange-rates/:id` now filters by `user_group_id`, preventing cross-group deletion

### Fixed
- **DB transaction wrapping for money operations** — `CreateTransaction`, `CreateSplitTransaction`, and `DeleteTransaction` now execute all DB writes (group + journal + transactions + balance updates + soft deletes) in a single database transaction, preventing inconsistent state on partial failure

### Added
- **E2E tests for API integration validation** — 31 Playwright tests covering settings (api-keys, preferences, notifications, profile), wallet members, rules group detail, and full API endpoint validation
- **E2E tests for all remaining pages** — 62 Playwright tests covering dashboard, wallets (list+create), transactions (list+create), categories (list+create), budgets (list+create), bills (list+create), recurring (list+create), piggy-banks (list+create), rules (list+create), tags (list+create), groups, currencies, exchange-rates, export, reports (4 pages), admin (users+audit-log), and full API endpoint validation for all 15 service endpoints

### Fixed
- **JWT secret startup validation** — `config.Load()` now rejects the default `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` value and secrets shorter than 32 characters in all non-development environments (previously only a warning in production)
- **Webhook URL SSRF prevention** — webhook create and update endpoints now validate URLs, blocking internal IPs (localhost, 127.0.0.1, private ranges), cloud metadata endpoints (AWS, GCP, GKE), and requiring http/https scheme
- **Null-safety in service helpers** — `JsonApiMany.data` now accepts `null` (Go backend returns `null` for empty slices), `unwrapMany` handles null gracefully
- **Unit tests for all 19 service layer modules** (127 tests) — currencies, groups, reports, export, admin, wallets, transactions, categories, budgets, bills, tags, piggy-banks, recurring, rules, auth, api-keys, preferences, notifications, wallet-members

- **All hardcoded text replaced with i18n** — loading, saving, error, confirm dialogs, empty states now use `t()` keys
- Wallet create form simplified to only API-accepted fields (removed unused balance/virtualBalance/iban/currency fields)

### Fixed
- Date fields serialized as ISO 8601 (RFC3339) for Go `time.Time` compatibility (tags, transactions, recurring)
- Numeric fields (`amount_min`, `target_amount`) stringified for Go string-typed JSON fields (bills, piggy banks)
- **Dark mode dropdown menus** — `cn-menu-translucent` now uses `var(--popover)` instead of hardcoded white (fixes white-on-white invisible text)
- Playwright dialog handler collision across serial tests (switched to `page.once`)
- `api-keys` page ghost button had `hover:text-destructive` duplicating base class (no hover feedback)
