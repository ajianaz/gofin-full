# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Add working logout button to sidebar footer (vanilla JS event listener via onMount, explicit localStorage cleanup)
- E2E tests: add explicit Content-Type/Accept JSON headers to all API requests
- E2E tests: update test password to `TestPass123!` to meet API complexity policy (3 of: uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char)
- E2E tests: use unique email per test with Date.now() + random suffix
- Add "Keluar"/"Logout" i18n key for sidebar

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **CI: add develop branch triggers** — CI pipeline now runs on push/PR to both `main` and `develop` branches for earlier quality gate feedback

### Fixed
- **Dev compose header** — Added "NOT for production" header to `docker-compose.yml` to clarify it's a local dev/Keycloak testing stack; `docker-compose.selfhost.yml` remains the production deployment target

### Security
- **Integration test migration verification** — All 13 UP migrations verified: 52 tables, 171 statements, 0 errors against PostgreSQL 18
- **Go vet** — Clean pass across all internal packages (no issues)
- **npm audit** — 7 low-severity transitive dependency vulnerabilities (bits-ui → runed → svelte-toolbelt → @sveltejs/kit); requires upstream library updates

### Added
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** — Contribution guidelines covering setup, code style, testing, commit conventions, and PR workflow

### Changed
- **README improvements** — Fixed license badge (Apache-2.0, not MIT), removed duplicate "Svelte 5" in tech stack, added endpoint count to API reference link, added contributing link, added screenshots placeholder section

### Fixed
- **TestLoad_FromEnvVars expected wrong Redis port** — Test asserted `redis-host:6380` but `REDIS_PORT` was not set in that test case, so default `6379` was used. Fixed assertion to match actual default.
- **TableCell colspan type mismatch (16 svelte-check errors)** — `colspan="N"` passed string to shadcn TableCell which expects `number`. Changed all 16 occurrences to `colspan={N}` across 9 files.
- **E2E test helper type mismatch (10 svelte-check errors)** — `expectCreated()` manually typed Playwright `Response.body()` as `Promise<string>` but Playwright returns `Promise<Buffer>`. Fixed by using native `Response` type.

### Documentation
- **Security docs updated** — Login lockout now documents in-memory fallback when Redis unavailable, rate limiting fallback documented, bcrypt cost corrected from 12 to 10 (matches `bcrypt.DefaultCost`)
- **Development docs updated** — `npm install` → `bun install`, component library reflects shadcn as primary, branch base corrected to `develop`

### Fixed
- **Change Password no longer wipes email** — `Update()` method was called with empty string `""` for email when only updating password, causing the user's email to be set to empty string. Added dedicated `UpdatePassword()` method that only updates the password column.
- **Analytics SpendingByCategory SQL type mismatch** — `COALESCE(c.id, 0)` failed because `c.id` is UUID and `0` is integer. Fixed to use proper nil UUID literal `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'::uuid`.
- **Audit Logs query uses non-existent `uuid_nil()` function** — PostgreSQL doesn't have a `uuid_nil()` function. Replaced with nil UUID literal for entity filtering.
- **Login lockout disabled when Redis unavailable** — `isAccountLocked()` returned `false` immediately when Redis was nil, completely bypassing login attempt tracking. Added in-memory sliding window fallback using `sync.Map` with periodic eviction goroutine.
- **44 internal error details leaked to API clients** — `NewWithDetail(500, "msg", err.Error())` exposed database errors, SQL details, and internal stack traces to API responses. Replaced with generic `ErrInternal` responses; error details now logged server-side via `log.Printf()`.

### Changed
- **All raw `<table>` elements migrated to shadcn Table** — 11 pages (categories, tags, api-keys, users, audit-log, groups, currencies, exchange-rates, spending-by-period, transactions, wallet members) now use `Table/TableHeader/TableBody/TableRow/TableHead/TableCell` components for consistent styling via `cn-table-*` CSS utilities
- **Responsive column hiding on mobile** — 8 table pages now hide less-critical columns on small screens using `hidden md:table-cell`: audit-log (changes), users (joined date), categories (transaction count), currencies (decimal places, status), exchange-rates (date), api-keys (created date), tags (date), transactions (category, wallet)
- **Skeleton row duplication bug fixed** — categories, audit-log, users, currencies, groups, api-keys, tags, wallet-members pages had duplicated skeleton rows rendering 25+ rows instead of 5; fixed to render correct count
- **Redundant CSS classes cleaned from Table components** — removed hardcoded `font-medium`, `text-muted-foreground`, `p-3`, `text-left` from `<TableHead>` and `p-3` from `<TableCell>` (already handled by `cn-table-head` and `cn-table-cell` utilities)
- **Stale `overflow-x-auto` wrappers removed** — shadcn `Table` component includes `cn-table-container` with built-in horizontal scroll, making manual wrappers redundant
- **ConfirmDialog replaces all `window.confirm()` calls** — 10 list pages (bills, budgets, categories, piggy-banks, recurring, rules, api-keys, tags, transactions, wallets) now use shadcn AlertDialog-based `ConfirmDialog` for delete confirmation, providing consistent UX and non-blocking UI
- **Skeleton loading states on all list pages** — 20 pages now show animated skeleton placeholders instead of "Loading..." text: 8 table pages (categories, tags, api-keys, users, audit-log, groups, currencies, wallet members), 2 card grid pages (wallets, budgets), 3 list card pages (bills, piggy-banks, recurring), 1 transaction table page, 2 rule card pages, 1 dashboard page, 2 settings pages (preferences, profile), 1 exchange-rates page
- **All raw `<select>` elements migrated to shadcn Select** — 26 selects across 12 pages now use `Select/SelectTrigger/SelectContent/SelectItem` components for consistent styling, keyboard navigation, and accessibility
- **EmptyState component adopted across all list pages** — 17 pages now use shared `EmptyState` component instead of inline `<p>` or `<td>` text for "no data" display
- **Non-clickable cards no longer show hover:shadow-md** — removed misleading shadow hover effect from wallet, budget, and rule cards that aren't interactive
- **Create forms standardized to FormCard** — 4 pages (transactions, budgets, bills, wallets create) now use shared `FormCard` component for consistent form layout
- **i18n key `common.deleteConfirm` added** — Indonesian and English locales now include confirmation dialog description text

### Removed
- **Card imports removed from FormCard-adopted pages** — bills/create, budgets/create, transactions/create, wallets/create no longer import raw Card components (using FormCard instead)
- **Manual ChevronDown overlays removed** — select elements that had custom chevron icons now rely on shadcn Select's built-in chevron
- **VitePress documentation site** — comprehensive docs with GitHub Pages deployment (Getting Started, Features, Architecture, Configuration, Deployment, Development, RBAC, Security, API Reference)
- **Architecture diagram** — interactive dark-themed SVG diagram showing Docker stack, API layers, auth providers, and data flow
- **GitHub Actions workflow** — auto-deploy docs to GitHub Pages on push to main (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`)
- **README overhaul** — clean project overview with badges, quick start, feature list, and docs links
- **Legacy docs archived** — moved research, plans, refactor notes, and old ARCHITECTURE.md to `docs/legacy/`

### Security
- **CORS no longer uses wildcard in non-production** — replaced `AllowOrigins: "*"` with localhost-only fallback (`localhost:5173`, `localhost:8080`); `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var now takes priority over all other settings
- **Panic details hidden in production** — recovery middleware no longer exposes exception details to clients unless `APP_DEBUG=true`
- **Login lockout uses email+IP key** — prevents account lockout denial-of-service by keying rate limit on `email:clientIP` instead of just `email`
- **Password complexity validation** — registration and password change now require at least 3 of 4 character types (uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character)
- **HSTS only sent in production** — `Strict-Transport-Security` header is now only set when `APP_ENV=production`; CSP is relaxed in debug mode for SPA compatibility
- **Disabled auth provider shows startup warning** — logs a prominent warning when `AUTH_PROVIDER=disabled` is active
- **Selfhost docker-compose requires security env vars** — `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` and `STATIC_CRON_TOKEN` must be explicitly set (no insecure defaults); docker-compose will fail fast if missing
- **Random password generation uses rejection sampling** — fixed modulo bias in OAuth auto-provisioned password generation

### Fixed
- **Wallet owner can list wallet members** — `GET /wallets/:wallet_id/members` now checks `IsWalletOwner` before `GetWalletRole`, allowing wallet owners to access members endpoint (was returning 404/403)
- **Test passwords meet password policy** — integration tests updated to use compliant passwords (`SecurePass1!`) matching the new 3-of-4 character type requirement
- **Redis default port assertion corrected** — unit test updated to expect port 6380 (security hardening changed default from 6379)
- **Export test mocks match implementation** — vitest tests for `downloadCSV` updated: `Content-Type` header now expected, `localStorage.getItem` mock changed from `mockReturnValueOnce` to `mockReturnValue` to cover dual-call pattern
- **Audit log response includes user_email** — `GET /audit-logs` now joins with users table to return `user_email` alongside `user_id`; audit repository types fixed from int64 to UUID to match database schema
- **Admin user list returns name, role, is_active** — `GET /admin/users` now includes `name` (email fallback), `role` (global role lookup), and `is_active` (NOT blocked) fields
- **Export handlers respect query parameters** — CSV and OFX export now parse `start`, `end`, and `wallet_id` query parameters to filter exported transactions
- **Transaction list includes amount and description** — `GET /transactions` now returns `description` and `amount` for each transaction group via lateral join
- **Analytics accepts YYYY-MM-DD date format** — `parseDateRange` now tries RFC3339, plain YYYY-MM-DD, and ISO timestamp formats when parsing date query parameters

### Changed
- **OpenAPI spec updated** — license changed to Apache-2.0, added `POST /users/me/password` endpoint, fixed `POST /groups/switch` request body (`user_group_id`), added tokens to group switch response, secured `/metrics` with bearer auth, fixed RBAC notes on configurations and groups endpoints, added piggy bank alias routes, added RBAC note to reconcile export
- **READMEs updated** — license changed from MIT to Apache 2.0 in root and api READMEs, added user endpoints and register endpoint to api README
- **TODO cleaned up** — marked completed mock-to-real API pages (currencies, groups, reports, export, admin) as done
- **License updated from MIT to Apache 2.0** — project license changed to Apache License, Version 2.0
- **Group switch uses tokens from response** — `setupGroup()` and groups page `handleSwitch` now extract JWT tokens directly from the `POST /groups/switch` response instead of making a separate refresh call
- **API client auto-refresh on 401** — transparent token refresh when a request returns 401; retries the original request with new tokens; redirects to login if refresh fails; deduplicates concurrent refresh calls to prevent infinite loops

### Added
- **JWT token version/invalidation mechanism (C6)** — `token_version` column on users table tracks token invalidation; JWT access and refresh tokens include `token_version` claim; `AuthMiddleware` compares claim version against DB and rejects mismatched tokens (401 "Token has been invalidated"); `IncrementTokenVersion` repository method for callers to invalidate all tokens for a user (called on logout, password change, group membership removal)
- **Database migration** — `000012_token_version.up.sql` adds `token_version INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` to users table
- **Change password endpoint** — `POST /users/me/password` validates current password, hashes new password (min 8 chars), and invalidates all existing JWT tokens via `IncrementTokenVersion`
- **Piggy bank alias routes** — `/wallets/:wallet_id/piggy_banks/:id/add` and `/remove` as aliases for `/add-money` and `/remove-money` for frontend compatibility
- **Database migration** — `000013_notes_locations_ownership.up.sql` adds `user_id` and `user_group_id` columns to notes and locations tables for ownership tracking

### Fixed
- **Internal error details removed from non-500 responses** — 5 handlers (group switch, create transaction, create split transaction, piggy bank add/remove money) no longer expose raw internal error strings to clients; replaced with user-friendly messages while logging the actual errors server-side
- **JWT re-issue on group switch** — `POST /api/v1/groups/switch` now returns a new JWT token pair with the updated `group_id` claim, so subsequent requests operate on the correct group without requiring re-authentication
- **Withdrawal balance check (H8)** — `CreateTransaction` now verifies source wallet has sufficient `virtual_balance` before processing withdrawal; returns error with current and required amounts
- **Split transaction balance check** — `CreateSplitTransaction` aggregates debits per source wallet and validates each has sufficient balance before processing
- **Piggy bank withdraw balance check (H9)** — `RemoveMoney` now verifies piggy bank has sufficient current amount (from events) before allowing withdrawal
- **Piggy bank add wallet balance check (H9b)** — `AddMoney` now verifies source wallet has sufficient `virtual_balance` before moving money to piggy bank
- **Transaction split URL mismatch** — frontend `transactionService.split()` now sends correct payload (`type`, `date`, `journals`) to `POST /transactions/split` matching the backend API
- **GroupRoleMiddleware DB error logging** — `GroupRoleMiddleware` now logs database errors from `GetUserRoleInGroup` instead of silently swallowing them, while still failing open for availability
- **API key group resolution for RBAC** — `APIKeyMiddleware` now resolves the user's active group from the users table via JOIN and sets `active_group_id` in context, enabling `GroupRoleMiddleware` and `RBACMiddleware` to work correctly for API key authenticated requests
- **User email update validation** — `PUT /users/me` now validates email format and checks for duplicates (returns 409) before updating
- **Email validation strengthened** — registration now uses `net/mail.ParseAddress` for proper RFC 5322 email validation instead of weak string checks
- **Removed unused import-usage hacks** — cleaned up `var _` declarations and unused `response` package import in auth handler
- **Refresh endpoint comment accuracy** — fixed misleading comment that incorrectly stated the endpoint accepts expired access tokens

### Fixed
- **Group update restricted to owner role (C1)** — `PUT /groups/:id` now requires `RoleOwner` RBAC middleware, matching the delete route
- **Wallet member Index group verification (C3)** — `GET /wallets/:wallet_id/members` now verifies the requesting user has a role on the wallet via `GetWalletRole`, returns 403 if unauthorized
- **Attachment Show/Delete user ownership (C4+H1)** — `Show` and `Delete` attachment handlers now verify the attachment belongs to the requesting user via `UserID` comparison, preventing cross-user access
- **DB transactions for money operations (C5)** — `CreateTransaction`, `CreateSplitTransaction`, and `DeleteTransaction` now wrap all multi-step operations (create group, journal, transactions, balance updates) in a single database transaction, preventing inconsistent state on partial failure
- **Webhook URL validation (H3)** — webhook create/update now validates URLs: blocks internal IPs (loopback, private ranges, cloud metadata endpoints), requires http/https scheme
- **JWT secret startup validation (H4)** — `config.Load()` rejects default JWT secret and secrets under 32 characters in production; development/testing/local environments are exempted
- **Rate limiter fail-secure on Redis failure (H5)** — when Redis is unavailable, the rate limiter now falls back to an in-memory sliding window limiter instead of allowing all requests through
- **Account lockout after failed logins (H6)** — after 5 consecutive failed login attempts, the account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes with a clear error message; counter resets on successful login; uses Redis INCR with TTL

### Fixed (Security Audit)

#### Critical
- **Notes group/user ownership scoping (C1)** — notes handler and repository now require user authentication, pass `user_id` and `group_id` on create, and verify ownership before update/delete
- **Locations group/user ownership scoping (C2)** — locations handler and repository now require user authentication, pass `user_id` and `group_id` on create, and verify ownership before delete
- **Configurations endpoint privilege escalation (C3)** — `POST /configurations` changed from `RoleOwner` to `AdminMiddleware()` to prevent non-admin users from setting system configurations
- **Attachments index group isolation (C4)** — attachment list now filters by `user_id`, preventing cross-user attachment visibility

#### High
- **Webhook messages IDOR (H1)** — `GET /webhooks/:id/messages` now verifies the webhook belongs to the requesting user's active group before returning messages
- **Audit logs using actual groupID (H3)** — audit log handler now passes the real `groupID` instead of hardcoded `0`
- **JWT invalidation on member removal (H4)** — removing a wallet member or deleting a group now calls `IncrementTokenVersion` to invalidate affected users' JWT tokens immediately
- **SSRF DNS rebinding prevention (H5)** — webhook URL validation now resolves DNS at validation time (not just string matching), preventing attackers from using DNS rebinding to reach internal services
- **Piggy bank TOCTOU race condition (H6)** — `AddMoney` now uses a DB transaction with `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row locking to prevent concurrent balance modifications
- **Request size limit middleware (H8)** — fixed the no-op `RequestSizeLimit` middleware to actually check `Content-Length` header and return 413; wired it into the router with `MaxRequestBodyBytes` config

#### Medium
- **Health endpoint error detail hiding (M1)** — `/health` now returns generic "connection failed" messages instead of raw DB/Redis error strings; actual errors are logged server-side
- **Password change rate limiting (H5)** — `POST /users/me/password` is now rate-limited at half the global rate limit to prevent brute-force of current password
- **Metrics endpoint authentication (M1)** — `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint moved behind authentication middleware, no longer publicly accessible without a valid token
- **Stop leaking internal error details (M2)** — replaced `NewWithDetail(500, ..., err.Error())` with server-side logging and generic `ErrInternal` responses in webhook, note, attachment, and audit handlers; prevents exposing DB schema, connection details, and file paths to API clients
- **WalletRBAC stop leaking internal errors (M3)** — wallet ownership and membership checks now log DB errors server-side and return generic 500 responses instead of raw error strings
- **Notes list user ownership filter (M4)** — `GET /notes` now filters results to only return notes owned by the requesting user, preventing cross-user note visibility within the same group
- **Attachment store nil check and type validation (M5)** — `POST /attachments` now validates user is authenticated and restricts `attachable_type` to known entity types (Transaction, Journal, Bill, PiggyBank, Recurring, Budget)
- **Login/OAuth error message hiding (M6)** — login failure now returns generic "Invalid email or password." instead of provider error details; OAuth callback failure returns generic "Authentication failed." to prevent provider-specific information leakage
- **Group delete membership verification (M7)** — confirmed `DELETE /groups/:id` correctly checks membership in the target group (not active group); no fix needed

#### Medium
- **JWT secret validation in all environments (M3)** — removed the dev/local/testing bypass; JWT secret length and default value are always validated
- **In-memory rate limiter memory leak (M4)** — added periodic eviction (every 5 minutes) to remove stale rate limit entries, preventing unbounded memory growth
- **Export service token handling (M5)** — export service now uses consistent token retrieval pattern matching the central API client
- **IPv6 SSRF bypass (M6)** — webhook URL validation now explicitly checks IPv6 private ranges (`::1/128`, `fe80::/10`, `fc00::/7`)
- **CSV injection prevention (M3)** — user-controlled fields in CSV export (description, category, wallet names, notes, tags) are prefixed with a single quote when they start with formula characters (`=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, carriage return)
- **Exchange rate delete group filter (L3)** — `DELETE /exchange-rates/:id` now filters by `user_group_id`, preventing cross-group deletion

### Fixed (Security Audit Round 2)

#### High
- **Note repository user_id filtering (H1)** — `FindByID`, `Update`, and `Delete` now require `user_id` parameter and filter by it in SQL, preventing cross-user note access via UUID guessing
- **Location repository user_id filtering (H2)** — `FindByID`, `GetByEntity`, and `Delete` now require `user_id` parameter and filter by it in SQL, preventing cross-user location access
- **Export reconcile RBAC (H3)** — `POST /export/reconcile` now requires `RoleManageTransactions` RBAC, preventing `read_only` users from creating transactions via reconcile

#### Medium
- **Attachment ListByEntityAndUser filter (M1)** — `ListByEntityAndUser` now actually filters by `user_id` in SQL; previously the parameter was accepted but not used in the query
- **Disabled auth provider production guard (M2)** — `AUTH_PROVIDER=disabled` is now rejected at startup in production environment, preventing accidental authentication bypass
- **Dead userID parameter removed (M3)** — removed unused `userID` parameter from `DeleteFullTransaction` repository method and all callers, reducing confusion about scoping
- **DB transaction wrapping for money operations** — `CreateTransaction`, `CreateSplitTransaction`, and `DeleteTransaction` now execute all DB writes (group + journal + transactions + balance updates + soft deletes) in a single database transaction, preventing inconsistent state on partial failure

### Added
- **E2E tests for API integration validation** — 31 Playwright tests covering settings (api-keys, preferences, notifications, profile), wallet members, rules group detail, and full API endpoint validation
- **E2E tests for all remaining pages** — 62 Playwright tests covering dashboard, wallets (list+create), transactions (list+create), categories (list+create), budgets (list+create), bills (list+create), recurring (list+create), piggy-banks (list+create), rules (list+create), tags (list+create), groups, currencies, exchange-rates, export, reports (4 pages), admin (users+audit-log), and full API endpoint validation for all 15 service endpoints

### Fixed
- **JWT secret startup validation** — `config.Load()` now rejects the default `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` value and secrets shorter than 32 characters in all non-development environments (previously only a warning in production)
- **Webhook URL SSRF prevention** — webhook create and update endpoints now validate URLs, blocking internal IPs (localhost, 127.0.0.1, private ranges), cloud metadata endpoints (AWS, GCP, GKE), and requiring http/https scheme
- **Null-safety in service helpers** — `JsonApiMany.data` now accepts `null` (Go backend returns `null` for empty slices), `unwrapMany` handles null gracefully
- **Unit tests for all 19 service layer modules** (127 tests) — currencies, groups, reports, export, admin, wallets, transactions, categories, budgets, bills, tags, piggy-banks, recurring, rules, auth, api-keys, preferences, notifications, wallet-members

- **Complete ruleService** — added `listGroups`, `getGroup`, `listRules`, `getRule`, `createRule`, `updateRule`, `deleteRule` methods
- **Additional service methods** — `piggyBankService.addMoney/removeMoney`, `transactionService.split`, `groupService.get/update/delete`, `authService.updateProfile/changePassword`
- New domain types: `Notification`, `WalletMember`, `ApiKeyListItem`, `ApiKeyCreateResponse`, `PreferenceItem`
- i18n keys: `settings.profile.saveSuccess`, `settings.profile.passwordMismatch`, `settings.profile.passwordRequired`, `settings.profile.passwordChanged`
- Tests verify JSON:API response unwrapping, field mapping (backend attribute names to frontend fields), default values for missing fields, error handling, and query string construction
- **Vitest unit test framework** — vitest + @vitest/coverage-v8 + jsdom for frontend unit testing
- `vitest.config.ts` with jsdom environment, path aliases ($lib, $components, $app), and globals
- Test scripts: `test` (single run), `test:watch` (watch mode), `test:coverage` (with v8 coverage)
- **Real API integration for admin pages** — admin users and audit log pages now use `adminService` API calls instead of mock data
- `adminService` in `web/src/lib/services/admin.ts` (listUsers, listAuditLogs methods)
- **Real API integration for export page** — CSV/OFX download via `exportService`, wallet dropdown populated from API
- `exportService` in `web/src/lib/services/export.ts` (downloadCSV, downloadOFX methods)
- i18n key `export.exporting` for English and Indonesian
- **Real API integration for all 4 reports pages** — reports overview, net-worth, spending-by-category, spending-by-period now use `reportService` API calls instead of mock data
- `reportService` in `web/src/lib/services/reports.ts` (spendingByCategory, spendingByPeriod, netWorth methods)

- `groupService` in `web/src/lib/services/groups.ts` (list, create, switch methods)
- i18n key `groups.switch` for English and Indonesian
- **Real API integration for currencies page** — replaced mock data with `currencyService.list()` call to `GET /api/v1/currencies`
- **Real API integration for exchange rates page** — replaced mock data with `currencyService.exchangeRates()` call to `GET /api/v1/exchange-rates`
- `currencyService` in `web/src/lib/services/currencies.ts`

### Removed
- 17 unused mock data files after all pages converted to real API (mock-audit-log, mock-bills, mock-budgets, mock-categories, mock-currencies, mock-exchange-rates, mock-groups, mock-notifications, mock-piggy-banks, mock-recurring, mock-tags, mock-transactions, mock-users, mock-wallets, mock-api-keys, mock-preferences, mock-rules)

### Changed
- **Settings/api-keys page uses real API** — replaced `mockApiKeys` with `apiKeyService.list()`, create shows raw key in alert, copy-to-clipboard for key prefix
- **Settings/preferences page uses real API** — replaced `mockPreferences` with `preferenceService.list()`, changes persist immediately via `preferenceService.set()`
- **Settings/notifications page uses real API** — replaced inline mock notifications with `notificationService.list()`, mark-all-read calls real API

- **Admin users page uses real API** — replaced `mockUsers` with `adminService.listUsers()`, added loading/error states
- **Audit log page uses real API** — replaced `mockAuditLog` with `adminService.listAuditLogs()`, entity filter re-fetches from API, action filter is client-side
- **Export page uses real API** — replaced `mockWallets` with `walletService.list()`, form submit triggers actual file download via `exportService`
- **Reports pages use real API** — replaced `mockTransactions`, `mockWallets`, `mockCategories`, `mockBudgets` with `reportService` and `walletService` calls, added loading/error/empty states
- **Currencies page uses real API** — replaced `mockCurrencies` with `currencyService.list()` including loading/error states
- **Exchange rates page uses real API** — replaced `mockExchangeRates` with `currencyService.exchangeRates()` including loading/error/empty states
- **Button hover feedback** — default, secondary, destructive buttons now use lightness shift instead of barely-perceptible opacity change
- **Sidebar hover contrast** — dark mode sidebar-accent lightness increased for better visibility
- **All hardcoded text replaced with i18n** — loading, saving, error, confirm dialogs, empty states now use `t()` keys
- Wallet create form simplified to only API-accepted fields (removed unused balance/virtualBalance/iban/currency fields)

### Fixed
- Date fields serialized as ISO 8601 (RFC3339) for Go `time.Time` compatibility (tags, transactions, recurring)
- Numeric fields (`amount_min`, `target_amount`) stringified for Go string-typed JSON fields (bills, piggy banks)
- **Dark mode dropdown menus** — `cn-menu-translucent` now uses `var(--popover)` instead of hardcoded white (fixes white-on-white invisible text)
- Playwright dialog handler collision across serial tests (switched to `page.once`)
- `api-keys` page ghost button had `hover:text-destructive` duplicating base class (no hover feedback)
